# I Built HamHome Because My Bookmarks Became a Graveyard

I used to bookmark everything.

Interesting articles. Docs I might need later. Tools I wanted to try. Great Reddit threads.

Then one day I realized I had hundreds of bookmarks and almost none of them were useful anymore.
I wasn’t collecting knowledge. I was collecting digital dust.

So I built **HamHome**.

It’s a browser extension for people who save a lot and hate losing context.

## What HamHome does (in plain words)

- **Save in one click** while you’re reading.
- **AI helps organize immediately**: title cleanup, summary, tags, and category suggestions.
- **Ask your bookmarks like a person**:
  - “What did I save about React performance?”
  - “Find that post about startup pricing from last month.”
- **Get answers with sources**, so you can jump straight back to the original links.
- **Import your existing bookmarks** from browser exports.
- **Keep folder structure** if you want, or let AI reorganize the mess.

## Privacy was not optional

I didn’t want a “smart” tool that quietly ships all my browsing data away.

HamHome is designed around **local-first storage** and clear AI boundaries.
You control what gets analyzed and when.

## Why this might be useful for you

If your bookmarks are currently a “save now, never find again” system, HamHome gives you:

1. Less friction when saving
2. Better structure without manual cleanup
3. A real way to retrieve things later

## Current status

- **Edge Add-ons version is live**
- **Offline package is available** from GitHub Releases
- Ongoing updates to search, import flow, and UI consistency

## Try it

- Edge Add-ons: https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/hamhome-smart-bookmark-/nmbdgbicgagmokdmohgngcbhkaicfnpi
- GitHub Releases: https://github.com/bingoYB/ham_home/releases

If you try it, I’d love blunt feedback:
- What feels great?
- What feels confusing?
- What made you stop using it?

That’s the fastest way to make this genuinely useful.

## Where to post this (recommended)

### 1) Product Hunt (highest priority for launch day)
- Best for: discovery by makers and early adopters
- Post style: product story + short demo + clear “who this is for”
- Key rule: don’t ask people directly for upvotes

### 2) Hacker News (Show HN)
- Best for: technical users who care about substance
- Post style: honest build story, architecture choices, tradeoffs
- Key rule: don’t use HN primarily for promotion; no vote solicitation

### 3) Reddit (targeted subreddits)
- Best for: niche communities (productivity, PKM, browser extensions, dev workflows)
- Post style: problem-first post (“how do you manage bookmark overload?”), then mention your tool
- Key rule: follow each subreddit’s self-promo policy and avoid repetitive posting

### 4) LinkedIn
- Best for: professionals and knowledge workers
- Post style: founder story + before/after workflow + quick product clip
- Why it fits: LinkedIn reports 1B+ members and strong professional reach

### 5) X / Threads (supporting channels)
- Best for: short clips, iteration updates, fast feedback loops
- Post style: one pain point per post, short video/GIF, direct CTA

## Suggested rollout order (simple)

1. Product Hunt (anchor launch)
2. Hacker News + Reddit (same 24h window, tailored copy)
3. LinkedIn (story post)
4. X/Threads follow-up clips over the next 7 days
